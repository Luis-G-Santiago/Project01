# Overview/description of the project

This website is based off the idea of opening my own Kung Fu San Soo school in Simi Valley, CA, USA.
It is intended for all who want to learn more about Kung Fu or Tai Chi.
The Kung Fu that I teach is based of a Southern Shaolin Style from Southern China.
The Tai Chi that I teach is the traditional Yang Style Tai Chi.

# Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered

The site is very clear, with information for every practitioner.
The top part is intended for each access to all the main topics: About; Classes; Photos; and Contact.
The bottom part has the exact location of where classes are held as well as the contact form to reach out.
The picture of the man at the top of the website is the Grandmaster himself, Jimmy H. Woo.

# Technologies Used ( .html , .css )

Technologies used are:
-HTML
-CSS
-Bootstrap

# Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)

Ways to imprrove would be:
-A contact form that links to my personal email address
-Links at the top that directed to the specific referenced sections
-More info buttons on schedule of classes section leads to a waiver form as well as payment plan option.
-The image carousel staying one size, and not having to cycle thru the images to correct the photos themselves.
-An additon link at the top that links to a waiver form, either one to download sign and present, or
an electronic form that can be filled out and signed, as well as submitted all thru the website would be ideal.
-Another great idea would be able to pay electronically thru the site itself for convenience.
-Having a database that both payments, as well as students were stored would be helpful for my use.
